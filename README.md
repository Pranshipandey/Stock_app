Task: Design and Stock model
- Attributes name, ticker_symbol and price
-Automate looking up stock(currently only possible through rails console)
-Automate API key insertion(instead of havin to key it in everytime we look up on a stock)
-This will expose us to secure credentials in Rails apps:
credentials.yml.enc (ancrypted file)
master.key (key to decrypt credentials file)
